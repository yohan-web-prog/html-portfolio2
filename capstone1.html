    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>A driven and industrious individual with a background in exercise physiology and passion for science. Making the transition from clinical practice to business, I have spent much of my career in sales, taking on roles of increasing responsibility in the pharmaceutical and medial device industries. Currently employed by Johnson & Johnson Medtech as a field sales trainer and product specialist, I own not just my individual sales targets but also coaching responsibilities for the NSW/ACT team. I have educated myself in development languages to further my career in digital technologies, which I believe to be the future of our industry.</p>
